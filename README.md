## 1. Find a use case when blockchain is not suitable for the problem: <br />
One use case, where a blockchain network is not a good idea, could be in database systems, <br />
that require low latency. The main problem is that its not easy to provide such low latency data manipulation <br />
with a blockchain system, that a centralized database system provides. <br />
<br />

## 2. Come up with a simple problem where blockchain is suitable: <br />
A simple use case for a problem, where a blockchain is suitable, is a business store management system. <br />
The blockchain would be private, storing data about the current storage state of a business, <br />
what kind of supplies the business stores and how much of them it stores. <br />
